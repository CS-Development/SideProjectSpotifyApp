# SideProjectSpotifyApp Case Study
Here we describe the features this app is going to support. We make use of the Agile specifications tools and language to describe the system in terms of use cases, features, user stories, scenarios, BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) specifications and acceptance criteria.

## **Albums Feature Specs**

### Story: User requests to see the new releases

### Narrative #1

```
As an online user
I want the app to automatically load the new albums releases
So I can always be informed on the newest music
```

#### Scenarios (Acceptance criteria)

```
Given the user has connectivity
 When the user requests to see the new albums releases
 Then the app should display the latest releases from remote
  And replace the cache with the new feed
```
